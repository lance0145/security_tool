Threat: Log (CVSS: 0.0)
Port:   443/tcp

Summary:
The script consolidates various information for CGI scanning.
  This information is based on the following scripts / settings:
  - HTTP-Version Detection (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.100034)
  - No 404 check (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.10386)
  - Web mirroring / webmirror.nasl (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.10662)
  - Directory Scanner / DDI_Directory_Scanner.nasl (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.1!
1032)
  - The configured 'cgi_path' within the 'Scanner Preferences' of the scan confi!
g in use
  - The configured 'Enable CGI scanning', 'Enable generic web application scanni!
ng' and
    'Add historic /scripts and /cgi-bin to directories for CGI scanning' within !
the
    'Global variable settings' of the scan config in use
  If you think any of this information is wrong please report it to the referenc!
ed community portal.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
The Hostname/IP "yahoo.com" was used to access the remote host.
Generic web application scanning is disabled for this host via the "Enable gener!
ic web application scanning" option within the "Global variable settings" of the!
 scan config in use.
Requests to this service are done via HTTP/1.1.
This service seems to be able to host PHP scripts.
This service seems to be able to host ASP scripts.
The User-Agent "Mozilla/5.0 [en] (X11, U; OpenVAS-VT 9.0.3)" was used to access !
the remote host.
Historic /scripts and /cgi-bin are not added to the directories used for CGI sca!
nning. You can enable this again with the "Add historic /scripts and /cgi-bin to!
 directories for CGI scanning" option within the "Global variable settings" of t!
he scan config in use.
The following directories were used for CGI scanning:
https://yahoo.com/
While this is not, in and of itself, a bug, you should manually inspect these di!
rectories to ensure that they are in compliance with company security standards

NVT:    SSL/TLS: NPN / ALPN Extension and Protocol Support Detection
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.108099
Threat: Log (CVSS: 0.0)
Port:   443/tcp

Summary:
This routine identifies services supporting the following extensions to TLS:
  - Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN)
  - Next Protocol Negotiation (NPN).
  Based on the availability of this extensions the supported Network Protocols b!
y this service are gathered and reported.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
The remote service advertises support for the following Network Protocol(s) via !
the NPN extension:
SSL/TLS Protocol:Network Protocol
TLSv1.0:HTTP/1.0
TLSv1.0:HTTP/1.1
TLSv1.0:HTTP/2
TLSv1.1:HTTP/1.0
TLSv1.1:HTTP/1.1
TLSv1.1:HTTP/2
TLSv1.2:HTTP/1.0
TLSv1.2:HTTP/1.1
TLSv1.2:HTTP/2
The remote service advertises support for the following Network Protocol(s) via !

NVT:    TCP timestamps
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.80091
Threat: Low (CVSS: 2.6)
Port:   general/tcp

Summary:
The remote host implements TCP timestamps and therefore allows to compute
  the uptime.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
It was detected that the host implements RFC1323/RFC7323.
The following timestamps were retrieved with a delay of 1 seconds in-between:
Packet 1: 3398875054
Packet 2: 3409636148

Impact:
A side effect of this feature is that the uptime of the remote
  host can sometimes be computed.

Solution:
Solution type: Mitigation
To disable TCP timestamps on linux add the line 'net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps = 0' to
  /etc/sysctl.conf. Execute 'sysctl -p' to apply the settings at runtime.
  To disable TCP timestamps on Windows execute 'netsh int tcp set global timesta!
mps=disabled'
  Starting with Windows Server 2008 and Vista, the timestamp can not be complete!
ly disabled.
  The default behavior of the TCP/IP stack on this Systems is to not use the
  Timestamp options when initiating TCP connections, but use them if the TCP pee!
r
  that is initiating communication includes them in their synchronize (SYN) segm!
ent.
  See the references for more information.

Affected Software/OS:
TCP/IPv4 implementations that implement RFC1323.

Vulnerability Insight:
The remote host implements TCP timestamps, as defined by RFC1323.

Vulnerability Detection Method:
Special IP packets are forged and sent with a little delay in between to the
  target IP. The responses are searched for a timestamps. If found, the timestam!
ps are reported.

Summary:
A traceroute from the scanning server to the target system was
  conducted. This traceroute is provided primarily for informational value only.!
 In the vast
  majority of cases, it does not represent a vulnerability. However, if the disp!
layed traceroute
  contains any private addresses that should not have been publicly visible, the!
n you have an
  issue you need to correct.
